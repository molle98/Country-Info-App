# Country Info App

This project shows country information using a frontend built with React and a backend built with Node.js (Express).

## Project Structure

The project has two main folders:

- **frontend** (runs on port 3000)
- **backend** (runs on port 5000).

## Setup

To set up the project, clone the repository and navigate to the `backend` folder. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`, then start the server with `npm start` (the backend will run on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)).

Next, navigate to the `frontend` folder, install the dependencies with `npm install`, and start the frontend with `npm start` (the frontend will run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)).

## Usage

Once both servers are running, visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to use the app. The frontend communicates with the backend via [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).
